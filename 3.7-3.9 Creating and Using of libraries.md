# 3.7-3.9 Creating and Using of libraries

I wanna the /media folder to generate the library file (.a, .so), so after link the files underneath /app/link_obj, which can add the library files to generate an mp3 file to execute.

Creating a new directory to store the .a file, which aims to static library.

## Generate and Use the Dynamic Library (DLL, .so) 

Give the source file (.c) a new makefile to ensure it under the DLL rule!

Add the file with "DLL  = libmath.so" Target to the common.mk file to add the compilation rule (Recipe)

### what means the instruction gcc -fPIC?

The GCC compiler flag `-fPIC` stands for "Position Independent Code." When you compile a program with this flag, it generates position-independent code that can be loaded and executed at any memory address.

Position-independent code is useful in certain scenarios, such as when creating shared libraries (also known as dynamic link libraries or DLLs). Shared libraries are designed to be loaded into different programs at runtime, and each program may load the library at a different memory address. By using position-independent code, the library can adapt to the specific memory location where it is loaded, allowing multiple programs to use the same library simultaneously.

When `-fPIC` is specified during compilation, the generated code contains relative memory references instead of absolute addresses. This enables the code to be relocated and executed from any memory location without any conflicts. Additionally, it allows the operating system's memory management system to perform address space layout randomization (ASLR), which enhances security by making it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory-related vulnerabilities.

To summarize, using `-fPIC` with GCC produces position-independent code, which is essential for creating shared libraries that can be loaded and executed at any memory address.
