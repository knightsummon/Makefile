# 4.7 Use libtool to build a dynamic link library

## Introduction to Libtool

Different Unix platforms, compilation, naming and management of shared libraries in different ways

Some platforms support dynamic loading, some platforms provide other mechanisms, some do not provide

Libtool abstracts the library, generates .la extension form, and supports different platforms

### Libtool

Including libtoolize and libtool

• Before using libtool, use libtoolize to generate **localized libtool**

## Scenario 1

In a fold /jpg which has a file named jpg.c stored all details of a jpg, I wanna compile the jpg.c to make a dynamic library which can be shared by all thread.

In different compile system, I must run the following commands to generate the dynamic library of jpg.c and load it to the memory.

```
gcc -fPIC -o jpg.o -c jpg.c
gcc -shared -o libjpg.so jpg.o ## Generate the object .o then generate the DLL
```

But I want it can be loaded directly into the usr/lib when we install the install package contain the dynamic libraries, So users will no need to run those commands upwards by themselves.

## Solution: Use libtool to solve

The libjpg.la is a dynamic library which has the common use attribute and can be used as dynamic library regardless difference compile platform.
