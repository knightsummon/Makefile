### How to generate .o from .c And How to link .o together for ELF Files

After we create the makefile in our project, when makefile compiled first time, It will create a file pre-requisites tree for project to generate ELF file

## Makefile Directives Category

Makefile directives are instructions or commands written in a Makefile that specify how to build and manage a software project using the make build automation tool. Makefile directives are used to define rules, dependencies, variables, and other aspects of the build process.

1. **Target and Rule**:

```
main: main.o utility.o
    gcc -o main main.o utility.o

main.o: main.c
    gcc -c main.c

utility.o: utility.c
    gcc -c utility.c

```

2. **Variables**:

```
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2 

main: main.o utility.o    
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o main main.o utility.o 
	
main.o: main.c    
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

utility.o: utility.c    
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c utility.c
```

3. **Phony Target**:

```
.PHONY: clean

clean:
    rm -f main *.o
```

4. **Include Directive**:

```
include config.mk

main: main.o utility.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o main main.o utility.o

main.o: main.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

utility.o: utility.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c utility.c
```

## Default Targets

How the "make" select the object .o to generate?

## Automatic Variables

![6](https://github.com/knightsummon/Makefile/blob/master/2.1-2.8%20Markdown%20Grammar%20and%20Principle.assets/6.jpg)

Target need := to explain a certain target for afterwards compiling!

## Conditional Execution

```markdown
ifeq ($X, Y)
else
endif
```

$X is a variable and Y is a value whether it matches the ifeq condition.

## The execution process of a Makefile 

1. **Parsing**: Make begins by parsing the Makefile, reading and interpreting its contents line by line.

2. **Target Evaluation**: Make identifies the specified target or targets to be built. It checks the dependencies and rules associated with each target.

3. **Dependency Resolution**: Make examines the dependencies of the target and checks if they exist or if they need to be built. If a dependency is missing or out-of-date, Make proceeds to build it by executing the associated commands.

4. **Rule Execution**: Make executes the commands associated with the target's rule. These commands typically compile source files, link object files, or perform other necessary build actions.

5. **Parallel Execution**: If the Makefile specifies parallel execution, Make may execute multiple rules simultaneously, taking advantage of available system resources. This can speed up the build process.

6. **Recursive Execution**: Make may encounter subdirectories with their own Makefiles. In such cases, Make recursively enters the subdirectories, parses their Makefiles, and repeats the execution process for each subdirectory.

7. **Up-to-Date Check**: Make checks if all the targets are up-to-date based on the modification timestamps of the files. If all targets are up-to-date or if no further actions are needed, Make terminates the execution process.
