# 4.4 Makefile of shallow directory structure

## Target

Generation and use of static libraries

Compilation of Makefile.am for each directory

Recursively  compile the dictionary using **SUBDIRS**

## Configure.ac

![1](https://github.com/knightsummon/Makefile/blob/master/4.4%20Makefile%20of%20shallow%20directory%20structure.assets/1.jpg)

./configure detect the each Makefile.am in each child work directory, to make Makefile file.

# Makefile.am in Root Work Directory

Touch a new makefile.am as total command in /chap4/Makefile.am as following:

```
AUTOMAKEFILE_OPTIONS = foreign

SUBDIRS = src
```
